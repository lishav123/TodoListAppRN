- Expo CLI and workflow
- File-based routing in Expo
- State management in React Native
- Handling user input and forms
- List rendering and key extraction
- AsyncStorage for local persistence
- Navigation (React Navigation basics)
- Styling with StyleSheet and Flexbox
- Debugging and hot reloading
- Best practices for mobile UI/UX

## Features
